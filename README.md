## Introduction

In this data science project, we delve into the intricate relationship between the rating of recipes and their caloric content. By analyzing a diverse dataset of culinary creations, our goal is to uncover patterns and correlations that may exist between the popularity or rating of a recipe and its nutritional value, specifically the number of calories. Through this exploration, we aim to provide insights that can inform healthier recipe choices while still appealing to taste preferences, potentially aiding in better dietary decisions and contributing to the broader understanding of how caloric content impacts culinary appreciation.

We start with 2 different datasets, one that contains recipes and the other contains reviews and ratings for the recipes by users.

| Column	| Description |
| 'name'	| Recipe name |
| 'id'	| Recipe ID |
|'minutes'	| Minutes to prepare recipe |
|'contributor_id'	| User ID who submitted this recipe |
|'submitted'	| Date recipe was submitted |
| 'tags'	| Food.com tags for recipe |
| 'nutrition'	| Nutrition information in the form [calories (#), total fat (PDV), sugar (PDV), sodium (PDV), protein (PDV), saturated fat (PDV), carbohydrates (PDV)]; PDV stands for “percentage of daily value” |
| 'n_steps'	| Number of steps in recipe |
| 'steps'	| Text for recipe steps, in order |
| 'description'	| User-provided description |
